This directory houses all of the files and programs related to the 2015 [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/day/1).

The purpose of these programs is not to demonstrate best practices. They are designed to solve exactly one problem at a time. I'm mostly using them to build my working knowledge of the languages I know. Plus, they're fun!

You will need several software packages and language runtimes in order to run the programs in this directory. I will not go over how to install these, but I will provide a list of languages I use and a link to their site if applicable.

While I intend to only submit changes that include working code, I make no guarantees that any of the code you find in here will run as-is. All of these programs are being developed on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf). If they do not work on your computer, there may need to be changes made to the code. That said, most of these programs use relatively simple language constructs.

Additionally, the .gitignore will be updated to include languages as I go, but I can't promise that there will be no conflicts. That means that the contents of one git ignore might cause certain files to not work correctly. Because of the nature of git, this shouldn't happen, as I'll only be uploading one directory at a time. Still, run at your own risk.

#Languages:
* [Go](http://golang.org)
